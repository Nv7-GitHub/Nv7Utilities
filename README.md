# Nv7's Utilities
These are utility apps that I have coded. Currently, only MacOS is supported. To install them, download the *.zip file and extract it. Once extracted, you should have a MacOS Application. 

## How to change the default app for a file
Knowing this is useful to change the default app for a file (or set the default app for a file). To do this, right-click on a file of the type you want to change. In the dropdown that comes up, select "Get Info". This should bring up a new window. In this window there should be a list of dropdowns. Select a dropdown titled "Open with:". Under this, select the dropdown which shows the default file opener, and choose "Other". Select the MacOS application you have extracted. Then, select "Open". Finally, select a button that says "Change All" below the dropdown.

## ArchiveMagick
ArchiveMagick is an Archive app I have coded due to to the lack of compatibity of Mac's default archive utility, Archive Utility. It supports RAR files in addition to the major Archive types supported by Archive Utility. Archive Magick supports Roshal Archive Compressed File (\*.rar) files, ZIP Compressed File (\*.zip), Compressed Tarball File (\*.tar.gz), and Gnu Zipped Archive (\*.gz).

## 3DOpen
3DOpen is a utility that will read, import, and open various 3D file types in Blender, a free, Open Source app. To use this app you will have to have a version of Blender >= 2.6. You can download Blender [here](https://www.blender.org/download/). Supported 3D file types are Collada (\*.dae), Alembic (\*.abc), Autodesk FBX (\*.fbx), Autodesk 3ds (\*.3ds), Wavefront (\*.obj), Extensible 3D (\*.x3d, \*.wrl), Stl (\*.stl), Stanford (\*.ply), Motion Capture (\*.bvh), and Scalable Vector Graphics (\*.svg).

## PDFClean
PDFClean is a utility that will clean up PDF files. Often with photo scanned files have artifacts near abrupt borders. This app solves these, making your PDFs easy to read. You simply have to select a file, select the quality, and select the file you wantt to save it as. The quality, a value between 1 and 50 dictates the resolution of the output. Generally, a higher quality leads to more satisfactory results but sacrifices time. I have found that a quality of 30 leads to nearly imperceptible quality while faster than the highest quality, 50.
