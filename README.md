# Nv7's Utilities
These are utility apps that I have coded. Currently, only MacOS is supported. To install them, download the *.zip file and extract it. Once extracted, you should have a MacOS Application. 

## How to change the default app for a file
Knowing this is useful to change the default app for a file (or set the default app for a file). To do this, right-click on a file of the type you want to change. In the dropdown that comes up, select "Get Info". This should bring up a new window. In this window there should be a list of dropdowns. Select a dropdown titled "Open with:". Under this, select the dropdown which shows the default file opener, and choose "Other". Select the MacOS application you have extracted. Then, select "Open". Finally, select a button that says "Change All" below the dropdown.

## ArchiveMagick
ArchiveMagick is an Archive app I have coded due to to the lack of compatibity of Mac's default archive utility, Archive Utility. It supports RAR files in addition to the major Archive types supported by Archive Utility. Archive Magick supports Roshal Archive Compressed File (\*.rar) files, ZIP Compressed File (\*.zip), Compressed Tarball File (\*.tar.gz), and Gnu Zipped Archive (\*.gz).

## 3DOpen
3DOpen is a utility that will read, import, and open various 3D file types in Blender, a free, Open Source app. To use this app you will have to have a version of Blender >= 2.6. You can download Blender [here](https://www.blender.org/download/). Supported 3D file types are Collada (\*.dae), Alembic (\*.abc), Autodesk FBX (\*.fbx), Autodesk 3ds (\*.3ds), Wavefront (\*.obj), Extensible 3D (\*.x3d, \*.wrl), Stl (\*.stl), Stanford (\*.ply), Motion Capture (\*.bvh), and Scalable Vector Graphics (\*.svg).

## PDFClean
PDFClean is a utility that will clean up PDF files. Often with photo scanned files have artifacts near abrupt borders. This app solves these, making your PDFs easy to read. You simply have to select a file, select the quality, and select the file you wantt to save it as. The quality, a value between 1 and 50 dictates the resolution of the output. Generally, a higher quality leads to more satisfactory results but sacrifices time. I have found that a quality of 30 leads to nearly imperceptible quality while faster than the highest quality, 50. 

## Im2Vid
I created this app to more easily convert my Blender Image Sequences to videos. Currently the only supported video formats are MPEG-4 and AVI, but I may add more support later. Support image formats are \*.bmp, \*.dib, \*.jpeg, \*.jpg, \*.jpe, \*.jp2, \*.png, \*.pbm, \*.pgm, \*.ppm, \*.sr, \*.ras, \*.tiff, \*.tif. All images should be sorted numerically and/or alphabetically. Sound is not supported. 

## TalkingCalendar
This app announces your calendar, instead of just playing an alarm. This is perfect for things like reminders, where you don't have to cancel the alarm and you immediately know what it is about. This app will require you to login to google. I tried getting Google to recognize me but it didn't work. I assure you that we are not going to steal any of your data and all of it is safe. In addition, this app is read-only so it is not going to delete anything. To login, first login through google. This will bring you to a screen that says "This app isn't verified". Press on the link that says "Advanced". Under this, there will be a link that says "Go to TalkingCalendar" (unsafe). Press on the link. I assure you TalkingCalendar is safe. It will bring up a dialog. Click allow. This will finally bring you to a screen, saying "Confirm your choices". Press Allow. Finally, you will get a token, which you will paste back into the app where it asks. Then, press "Submit!"
